- For open tasks in this repository, please see the [Issues section](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/issues).
- Raise mistakes, errors or missing information on this repository by opening a [Pull Request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/pulls)
  - Read details on [how to open a Pull Request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request)
  - Submit trivial fixes (for example, a typo, a broken link or an obvious error)
  - Start work on a contribution that is already listed as an issue or something you’ve already discussed
  - A Pull Request doesn’t have to represent finished work. It’s usually better to open a Pull Request early on, so others can watch or give feedback on your progress. Just mark it as a “WIP” (Work in Progress) in the subject line. You can always add more commits later.
