# How to contribute?

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. üéâ

This project is being developed openly and invites contributions from anyone with prior experience in computer vision or scientific disciplines represented in the project.
You can suggest features to include in scivision, report mistakes/bugs, create Pull Requests to fix an error, offer resources or help develop or review new pieces of code.

We have a [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) that applies to all the activities related to this project.

Whatever is your availability, there is a way to contribute to this GitHub repository.

- For open tasks in this repository, please see the open [Issues](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/issues).

- To contribute to this repository (including bugfixes and new code features, as well as documentation, fixes to typos, broken links), open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/scivision/pulls).

- Our basic workflow is [GitHub flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).  In particular:
  - The branch `main` always contain the latest working version of the package.
  - Pull Requests should normally have `main` as their base branch (this is the default).
  - A Pull Request doesn't have to represent finished work. Pull Requests are welcome at an early stage of work on a contribution, so others can watch or give feedback, or as a place to discuss the work in progress---you can always add more commits to the same branch later, and they will be included too. If it is not ready to merge, include "WIP" (Work in Progress) in the subject line, or select "Create Draft Pull Request" when opening it.
  - For a Pull Request to be ready to merge:
    - All of the automated tests should pass
    - It should add tests of any new functionality
  - A code review can be requested at any time
  - Pull requests are [squash merged](https://github.blog/2016-04-01-squash-your-commits/) to `main`

### Releases

This section is for developers making a release: Most contributors
should instead read the notes on opening a Pull Request above.

We periodically make releases of the software on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/scivision/).

To make a new release:
  - Make a new branch the release (e.g. named `release/1.1.0`). Usually this will be branch off the current `main`.
  - Make sure that the version number is bumped in `setup.py`
  - When ready, request a review and merge into main
  - Make a GitHub [release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) (which will also make a tag)
  - (add/link to PyPI instructions here)
